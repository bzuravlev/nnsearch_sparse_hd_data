This software accompanies the paper:
    Peer Neubert and Stefan Schubert (2022), "SEER: Unsupervised and 
    sample-efficient environment specialization of image descriptors", 
    Proceeding of Robotics: Science And Systems, New York, USA

The actual SEER algorithm (in a batch variant) is implemented in runSEER.m

demo_SEER.m demonstrates the encoding and evaluation on the GardensPointWalking 
day_left vs. night_right sequences. To use the test data from the website, 
place it inside the code folder or adapt the paths in demo_SEER.m
